# CrowdCoin

CrowdCoin dApp is the result from Udemy's Ethereum course https://www.udemy.com/ethereum-and-solidity-the-complete-developers-guide/

It's a sort of decentralized Kickstarter where people can start / deploy their own campaigns and contributors can approve requests to move funds from the contract.

# Installation

To run the project in your local environment just run in your terminal:

`npm install`

then

`npm run dev`

Finally, you will be able to access the CrowdCoin dApp in your browser on `localhost:3000`

# Requisites

You'll need to install Metamask extension (https://metamask.io/) in your browser and get some ETH in the Kovan testnet to interact with the contract.
You can of course deploy your own instance of CampaignFactory in the environment of your choice, that's up to you. The deployed default contract in this repo runs on Kovan testnet.
